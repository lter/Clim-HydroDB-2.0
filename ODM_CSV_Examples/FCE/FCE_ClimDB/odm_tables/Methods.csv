PRECIP,"Precipitation data are downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center Website, Daily Station Summaries for station GHCND:USC00082850: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00082850/detail. Value in precipitation or snow is a 24 hour total at Time of Observation, accumulated since last measurement. Time of Observation (2 digit hour, 2 digit minute) is the 24 hour clock time of the observation given as the local time at the station of record: 0830. A Standard Rain Gage is used.
