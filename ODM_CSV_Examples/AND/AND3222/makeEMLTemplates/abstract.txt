A three-level hydro-climatological network for data monitoring was established in 1994. The networks at each level are nested to form a coordinated program of data acquisition and measurement. The first-level in this top-down approach consists of Benchmark Meteorological Stations (BMS) and Benchmark Stream Stations. The BMS are designed to represent the environment across the Andrews. These stations are intended to provide complete, long-term, high temporal resolution, meso-scale hydroclimatological data. The location of the BMS network is based on factors such as elevation, aspect, vegetation gradients, and accessibility. Collected meteorological parameters are generally standardized across the BMS as well as methods and instrumentation. The Primary Meteorological Station (PRIMET), Central Meteorological Station (CENMET), Upper Lookout Meteorological Station (UPLMET), and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological Station (VANMET) are the four Benchmark Stations. Air temperature data from those stations were converted averaged over 15 minutes and converted to CUAHSI ODM format and associated tables created.
