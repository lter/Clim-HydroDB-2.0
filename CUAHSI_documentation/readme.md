# Guide to CUAHSI Documentation

This folder contains documentation and templates provided by CUAHSI related to the Observations Data Model (ODM) and loading data into their system.  You can find more document on [CUAHSI's website](https://www.cuahsi.org/data-models/publication/).

[Standard_Formatting_Template.xlsx](Standard_Formatting_Template.xlsx) is a spreadsheet with worksheets representing the CSV files that you will create for your data packages. The spreadsheet includes instructions for each column and is a great place to start when preparing your data.  When finished, you would export the relevant worksheets to CSV files.  [Advanced_Formatting_Template.xlsx](Advanced_Formatting_Template.xlsx) is an advanced template with additional tables if you need more than the minimum set of metadata. Note that both templates have been modified to fix some mistakes and make them more friendly to climDB data publishers.

Their [formatting guide](CUAHSI_Formatting_Guide.pdf) explains how to create CSV files of data that are compatible with fields from ODM. You can look here if the explanations in the templates are insufficient, or if you do not want to use the templates.

Their [uploading guide](Standard_Uploading_Guide_1.pdf) explains how to upload data into their system.  You would only use this guide if you plan to archive our data with CUAHSI in addition to EDI.

For more details on the meaning of a column in ODM beyond what is available in the templates, see the [ODM Design Specifications](odm1.1designspecifications.pdf).
