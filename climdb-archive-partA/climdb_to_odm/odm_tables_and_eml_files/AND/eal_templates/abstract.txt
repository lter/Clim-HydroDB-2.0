The National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program and many  U.S. Forest Service Experimental Research Stations collect and maintain extensive, long-term ecological databases including streamflow and meteorological measurements. These databases have been widely used in intersite comparisons, modeling studies, and land management-related studies.  Intersite research was facilitated by a centralized database called Climate and Hydrology Database Projects (CLIMDB/HYDRODB), initiated in 1998.  The database was actively maintained until approximately 2015, and received contributions from 45 contributing LTER and USFS sites.  In 2018, it was decided that a more modern system aligned with a broader community would be more appropriate for this type of data.  The system maintained by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI) was chosen.

This data package contains data contributed by the site H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (AND) to ClimDBHydroDB, which has been reformatted to the Observations Data Model (ODM) 1.1 model for contribution to the CUAHSI system. This package contains the six data tables required for upload to CUAHSI. Data are available for 16 station(s): (1) Climatic Station at WS#2 (1957,2016), (2) Primary Meteorological Station (1972,2016), (3) GSWS01 (1952,2016), (4) GSWS02 (1952,2016), (5) GSWS03 (1952,2016), (6) GSWS06 (1963,2016), (7) GSWS07 (1963,2016), (8) GSWS08 (1963,2016), (9) GSWS09 (1968,2016), (10) GSWS10 (1968,2016), (11) Mack Creek Gauging Station (1979,2016), (12) Lookout Creek Gauging Station (USGS 14161500) (1949,2020), (13) Central Meteorological Station (1995,2016), (14) Hi-15 Meteorological Station (1963,2016), (15) Upper Lookout Meteorological Station (1994,2016), (16) Vanilla Leaf Meteorological Station (1987,2016).
