directory contains metadata files for EAL.

highest level (this dir)  is for metadata files that EAL will actually use.
other dirs:

table_desc_sql_types: holds files as they were generated by the script mssql_create_EALtemplate_attribute.sh. That script puts the sql server type into the "class" column.  It could have been called "incoming", (but its hard to know what that means - incoming from where?)

temp: temporary space for holding files, e.g, that were edited from the incoming. 

To be resolved:
the script generated attribute tables have sql-server types. these will not work with either R or with EML. Because of the nature of the DB's table design, I think that almost all columns will need to be classed as "char" in R, and then will become strings in EML. This is because the DB is designed with long format tables.

Numeric columns (e.g., values): a unit or precision cannot be applied to the entire column

id columns: could be stored as integers, and classed as either numeric or strings. if numeric, the unit would be dimensionless
every table has ID columns (the pk and often references)

Dates: not sure if a date format was enforced on these in climdb.
