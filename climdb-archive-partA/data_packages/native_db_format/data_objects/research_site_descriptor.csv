Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites have been designated in eleven ecosystems under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. Meteorological observations are part of the needed baseline data. An early accomplishment of this coordinated research program is a standard for LTER meteorological stations. National goals of the LTER program and the research objectives at each site are related in this report to specific needs for meteorological data that defined the concept and structure of the station standards. Each meteorological station must serve two purposes, support ongoing research at the site and provide climatic data for long-term studies and inter-site comparisons. The recommended standard is flexible. It establishes a core level of participation yet allows for considerable variation in data requirements of different ecosystems.

Continuous records of streamflow, precipitation, and other meteorological variables began at Coweeta in 1934. Since then, data collection, processing, and archiving have changed from tedious manual techniques to computerized methods that have significantly increased accuracy and availability of information. Methods developed at Coweeta have been adopted and applied by national and international research groups. This paper reviews the concepts and procedures developed to collect, edit, and reference for users of these data.

Streamflow from an undisturbed forested watershed is the net result of the physiology of the catchment and its climate. In early reports on the research in the southern Appalachian Mountains, Hursh championed studies to describe and develop understanding of climate, precipitation, soils, and topography of these mountains and how they interact with forest vegetation to produce streamflow. The state of knowledge of climate and streamflow in the Coweeta Basin and understanding of interactions with topography and vegetation are subjects of this chapter.

"8","7","4","Climate:
Observations were made twice a day at 0800 and 1700 through 1957. Beginning in 1958, observations were made at 0900 Eastern Standard Time only. Since March 1968, observations have been made at 0800 EST. All observations of air temperature are made with Hg thermometers and are currently backed up by both replicating chart recorders and electronic data logger observations. Daily maximum temperature observations are recorded as the previous days maximum temperature. When direct observations are not made on holidays and weekends, values are extracted from the chart recorder. Precipitation at CS01 is observed daily whereas precipitation at the high elevation site is observed weekly. Week long totals and weekend/holiday totals are separated into daily amounts using adjacent weighing/recording rain gages. Global solar radiation began in July 1960. Radiation is sensed by an Eppley Pyrheliometer and recorded on a Campbell data logger. Some evaporation measurements at CS01 have been made using National Weather Service class A type pans. However, data reported here are derived from a buried pan 36 inches in diameter and 18 inches deep, providing a more representative climatic norm for evaporation.

Flow:
Discharge for WS18 is measured with a 120 degree sharp crested weir. The weir blade is installed in a concrete wall that serves as a broad-crested weir for flows over 3 feet. The first record was collected on July 3, 1936 using Stevens L-Type chart recorder. The recorder was changed to an FW-1 January 6, 1955, upgraded to Fisher-Porter Analog to Digital punched tape recorder on September 3, 1964, and to the current Stevens Type A/E Logger, Model 8901 on November 9, 1994.","2009-10-15T09:04:27.980Z"

Bowles, David S.; Riley, Paul J.; Shih, George B.  An Application of the Utah State University Watershed Simulation Model To The Entiat Experimental Watershed, Washington State.  Utah Water Research Laboratory, College of Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, Utah.  October 1975; PRWG126-1.
To study the effects of a forest fire on runoff characteristics, the Utah State University Watershed Simulation Model (USUWSM) was applied to three small drainage areas  in the Entiat Experimental Forest, located within the Wenatchee National Forest of central Washington.

Pamplet.  1975.  Operation Pheniox.
Summarizes the efforts of scientists at the Forest Hydrology Laboratory in Wenatchee, Washington, after the 1970 wildfire in the Entiat Experimental Forest.  Focus changed from harvest effects on water yield and temperature to effects of wildfire and salvage logging.

Berndt, H. W. 1971.  Early effects of forest fire on streamflow characteristics.  Portland, OR:  Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experimental Station; PNW-RN-148.  9p.
A comparison of streamflow records from three small mountain streams in north-central Washington before, during and after a severe forest fire showed three immediate effects of destructive burning: 1) flow rate was greatly reduced while the fire was actively burning,  2)  destruction of vegetation in the riparian zone reduced diurnal oscillation of flow rates, and 3)  flow rates quickly increased to points above protracted normal depletion rates but to varying degrees.  No drastic immediate change in stream temperature was noted.

Fowler, W. B.; Tiedemann, A. R. 1980.  Phenological relationships of Spiraea betulifolia Pall. And Apocynum androsaemifolium L.  Northwest Science. 54(1): 17-25.
The phenology of two widespread understory species was examined at three elevations during two seasons, 1972 and 1973.  Occurrence of several identified phonological phases related well to the accumulated temperature at the site but poorly to calendar date or soil moisture content.  Phenological phases of transplant stock form high to low elevation and the reverse followed native plants at the site in the case of Spiraea, but were seemingly insensitive to local control in the high to low transplants of Apocynum.

Chemical output of nitrate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and organic nitrogen were determined on a grams-per-hectare-per-day basis for five treatment watersheds and a control watershed.  Water samples were collected from April to October during 3 pretreatment and 3 posttreatment years (1978 to 1983).  Except for increased calcium and sodium in several streams, regression equations comparing treatment with control showed no significant difference for pretreatment and posttreatment output.  Output generally declined in the posttreatment years.  Cyclic changes in output from these and other streams in the eastern Cascade Range in Washington appeared to occur regardless of treatment and were probably related to precipitation. Mean maximum air temperature increased during the post-treatment period in all the small watersheds, but stream temperatures were relatively unaffected.

Flow was measured from three forested watersheds, each containing about 2 square miles of drainage area, for 9 years before a severe wildfire destroyed the vegetation.  Flow records from two larger streams were used as control data for determining 1st-year effects of the fire on water yield and stream temperature.  Water yield increases, which ranged from 2.7 to 4.1 inches and averaged 3.5 inches, apparently came during snowmelt and during the summer months.  During late summer when streams were exposed to direct insolation, maximum daily stream temperature was increased by as much as 10° F.  No temperature changes were detected during the winter when stream channels were covered with snow.

Fire burns many acres of valuable forested land in the West almost every year.  One of the worst years on record was 1970, when more than 120,000 acres (485.6 km²) in north-central Washington alone were burned over.  Included in this area was the Entiat Experimental Forest, where hydrologic measurements began in 1959.  Although the fire on the experimental area caused considerable loss to planned research, it has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate some effects of deforestation on the water resource and other watershed values.  The effects of the fire on water yield and on stream temperatures during the first post-fire year have been reportes.  The objectives of this paper are to review the first year results, to add recent findings on water yields, and to present information on soil movement and channel cutting since the fire.

Before the fire on the Entiat Experimental Forest in August 1970, one main objective of research on the Forest was to document changes in quantity, quality and timing of runoff after timber harvest.  The present objective is to determine changes in these hydrologic values after wildfire.  Instead of planned reduction of vegetation by logging, which was to involve no more than one-third of each watershed at one time, practically all the vegetation of the three watershed on the Forest was destroyed within a few hours.  For the first time in the Northwest, detailed hydrologic data were available from an area undisturbed by man and probably not burned by wildfire in the past 200 years.  In this paper, we compare pre-fire and post-fire data to determine changes in annual yield, chemistry and temperature of water.  In addition, some information is presented on air and soil temperature changes.  Another symposium paper by Tiedemann and Klock gives a detailed description of the watersheds and fire.

Climatic and hydrologic measurements were made on three watersheds, each containing approximately 2 square miles (5.18 km²) in drainage area, for 9 years under natural forested conditions.  This paper describes the watersheds with respect to soils and geology, morphology, vegetation, precipitation and other climatic parameters and flow, sediment, temperature and chemistry of streams during this period.

Runoff was measured from a 564-ha catchment located on the Entiat Experimental Forest for years before a severe wildfire in 1970 destroyed the mixed conifer vegetation.  Runoff records form the Chelan River (2,393km²) were used as control data for determining changes in water yield during the seven years following the fire.

"24","21","4","Climate and hydrologic data have been collected from up to 7 watersheds in and adjacent to the Marcell Experimental Forest since 1961. 
TEMPERATURE:
Air temperatures are measured at 3 locations: the South Unit Upland (NW side of watershed S2); South Unit Bog (Bog in watershed S2); North Unit Upland (NE side of watershed S5). Each site is equipped with a Belfort model 594-1 hygrothermograph and a US Weather Bureau style max/min thermometer, which are housed in Standard NWS Shelters. Missing chart values are estimated from the max/min thermometer readings. Daily max/min temperatures are estimated from the charts to the nearest degree F and entered by hand.  Data collection has been continuous since 1961 from the S2 Upland site, since 1962 from the S5 Upland site, and since 1989 from the S2 Bog site.
PRECIPITATION:
Each watershed in the MEF has at least 2 8"" Standard USWB Precipitation Gauges. Three sites are also equipped with Belfort Universal Recording Precipitation Gauges. They are supported on 2-ft diam wooden platforms that hold the gauge tops 5-ft above the ground. Gauges are re-levelled annually to correct for frost-heaving. Gauges at non-wooded sites are protected with USWB Alter-Type Windshields, and all gauges are cleaned, lubricated and re-calibrated annually.
Precipitation data are collected on a weekly basis. Rainfall is measured to the nearest 0.01"" in the receiving tube, while snowfall is measured gravimetrically in gauges charged with antifreeze and oil to reduce evaporation. The daily values provided are obtained only from 2 of the sites equipped with recording gauges (S2-Upland and S5-Upland). Daily values are transcribed by hand from the recorder charts. Weighted values are estimated for each watershed using the Thiessen Polygon Method.
Data are continuous from 1961 for watershed S2 and from 1962 for watershed S5.
STREAM DISCHARGE:
Runoff from calibrated watersheds is currently measured at 5 location on the MEF: S2, S4-North, S4-South, S-5 and S6. Each watershed has a single channel outlet except for S4, which has two. Flow is monitored with 120-degree V-Notch Weir Blades attached to concrete cutoff walls, which are perpendicular to the channels and long enough to force all flow through the weirs. S-2 Weir is equipped with a Stevens Type A-35 strip chart recorder, while all other weirs have Belfort FW-1 strip chart recorders. The recorders are mounted above the float wells in ponds behind each weir and housed in plywood shelters. Float and pulley systems are used to monitor water depth in each weir notch. Chart readings are adjusted to match weekly aluminum point gauge readings. Point gauge and weir notch elevations are verified annually against a known benchmark. All recorders are cleaned and lubricated at least annually. Missing flow values are estimated from precipitation and bog well records as well as runoff data from neighboring watersheds. 
Peak flows in these watersheds is generally less than 57 Lps; positive flows usually start in late March with snowmelt and continue through early winter. Plywood covers over the weirs help prevent freezing during transitional periods.

Depth values in the weirs are calculated from the recorder charts using Sigma Scan and a SummaSketch III Professional digitizing pad to create data files, which are processed with a MS Visual Basic script to calculate mean daily flow
rates.

Data are continuous from 1961 for S-2 Weir, from 1962 for S-4 and S-5 Weirs, and from 1964 (missing 1973, 1976) for S-6 Weir.","2011-12-19T15:07:39.126Z"

Measurement Techniques: Automated weather stations  Weather station includes a 3 m tripod tower on which is  mounted most of the monitoring equipment.  This equipment includes an enclosure which houses a datalogger and power supply, On the tripod are mounted a solar radiation shield which encloses a combination temperature and relative humidity sensor, anemometer and wind vane, and a pyranometer.  Other attached sensors are a precipitation gauge, soil temperature sensors and soil moisture potential sensors.","2012-11-21T13:53:18.290Z"

"40","36","4","Many different experiments have been conducted on the Santee Experimental forest since measurements began in 1946, the most notable research on the study site involved prescribed fire, pine siliviculture, nutrient cycling and water quality.  During 1976, stream gauges were installed at the outflow of the paired watersheds under the direction of C. Ennis Young and were used to evaluate the effects of prescribed fires on stream water quality and nutrient cycling.  The treatment watershed was divided into 20 pine management compartments, each 7.1 ha, with 20 m wide buffer strips left bordering the stream channels.  During the winters of 1976-77, 1977-78, and 1978-79, a total of 12 compartments were burned, four each year.  Three summer burns were also conducted during 1976-77.  Stream nutrient outputs from the treatment and control watershed were compared before and after prescribed burning.  The nutrient outputs from the treatment watershed reflected the response of an operational forest, and illustrated that periodic prescribed fires in the southeaster coastal plain pine forests are not likely to have an appreciable effect on the quality of ground or stream waters.  On September 22, 1989, the eye of Hurricane Hugo passed through the Francis Marion National Forest and the forest was badly damaged by the hurricane.  Subsequently, the treatment watershed (#77), but not the control watershed (#80), was salvage logged (Personal Communication, William Harms, Research Forester, Southern Research Station).  Water Samples were collected immediately after the hurricane and have been collected regularly since.  The watershed gauges, which had been deactivated in 1981, were reactivated in January 1990 (Bill Harms, Personal Communication).  In 1964, water level monitoring wells were placed in Watershed #77.  The measurement of these wells stopped in 1971.  In 1992, a new set of wells was placed in both watersheds.  When these wells were installed, a soil particle size analysis was run at the well sites.  These wells were manually measured until 1996.  In 1996, the manual measurements were replaced with electronic measurements by placing continuously recoding well monitors on three of the wells, and creating prediction equations for the rest of the wells using the 1992-1995 data.  Manual weather measurements (rain and temperature) started at the Santee Headquarters in 1946 and today there are four weather measuring devices on the experimental forest.  Three stations measure rain and temperature:  the Lottie Road station started taking measurements in 1971, the rain gauge on Watershed #77 started taking rain measurements in 1963 and temperature measurements in 1996, and the rain gauge on Watershed # 80 started taking rain measurements in 1990 and temperature measurements in 1996.  An electronically recording weather station was erected at the Santee Headquarters in 1996, and currently measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation.  During the fall of 1994, as a part of a larger study on the recovery of the forest from Hurricane Hugo by Chuck Gresham et. al. (1994), permanent plots were located on Watershed #80.  On each plot, they conducted an inventory of trees, advanced regeneration, coarse woody debris (standing and down) and canopy density and frequency.  In addition, wells to monitor the depth of the water table were installed in each plot.  One of the preliminary conclusions from these studies was that the regeneration forest was not of the species composition of the pre-hurricane community, and that the large amount of coarse woody debris is releasing large amounts of carbon and nutrients to the ecosystems (Gresham et al. 1994).  In 1998, a long term study of vegetation dynamics was initiated in the watersheds (Burke 1998).  Four 0.1 ha plots were located in each of the watersheds, and the ecological importance of herbaceous and woody vegetation (density, cover or basal area, species diversity) and dimensions of trees (diameter, breast height, and height) were measured (Bailey, in prep).","2004-06-28T11:52:58.896Z"

"41","37","4","The Tenderfoot Research Project was designed to test an array of 2-aged management treatments for regenerating and restoring healthy lodgepole pine forests through emulation of natural disturbance processes, but avoiding catastrophic-scale disturbances.   

The project was developed to determine the effects of shelterwood with reserve harvest systems including prescribed burnining on regeneration response, growth and survival of regenerated trees, growth response of residual overstory, water production, changes in water chemistry, and suspended sediment production.

Two harvest treatments are being tested (1) shelterwood with reserves with even distribution and (2) shelterwood with reserves with group or clumpy distribution of reserve trees.  For each silvicultural treatment there are four replications of each with prescribed underburning and four replications with no underburning.  Two uncut units with prescribed burning are used to compare results with the harvest and burn treatments.  Water production is being measured with water level recorders at 15 minute intervals and water chemistry is manually collected and measured periodically.  Suspended sediment production is measured daily with automatic sediment samplers.

precision self-contained recording instrument that measures and 
records ambient temperature and relative humidity simultaneously on a 
double scale chart. A specially treated bundle of human hair is used 
to measure relative humidity over the full range of 0 to 100%. The 
hair expands and contracts with increasing or decreasing amounts of 
water vapor in the air. The Belfort Maximum Minimum Thermometer Cat 
No. 5-484 indicates the temperature extremes reached over a 24 hour 
period and is the standard for adjusting chart temperature readings. 
The chart is installed on a self-contained brass clock which is 
spring-wound.  Chart record is no longer being maintained. 
Hygrothermograph chart records were maintained at the Climatic Station 
from February 1958 until October 1998. 
Chart temperature (daily max and min) is hand-digitized and adjusted to standard 
max-min temperatures. Standard maximum and minimum thermometers on a 
Townsend support are noted weekly to make adjustments to the chart record. 
While it would be possible to digitize the temperature and humidity to 
create a high temporal resolution record, this effort has not been attempted.

"44","1","183","Glacial, fluvial, and mass wasting processes have affected soil development and spatial distribution, particularly in geologic contact zones and steeper areas of the HJA. Infiltration rates are high and non-localized overland flow has not been observed in any of the watersheds. In Watershed 1, soils range from shallow and stony with little profile development to moderately deep with well-developed profile features. Shallow soils predominate, though they are often located on deep (> 3 m) deposits of unconsolidated soil and rock material. Most soil series present have moderately high field capacities (approximately 20 cm H2O for the surface 1.3 m of soil) and rapid rates of saturated moisture movement. Percolation rates are typically greater than 12 cm/hr due to the large amount and size distribution of pore spaces (Rothacher et al. 1967). Stone content is the dominant factor causing variation in soil moisture storage capacity (Dyrness 1969). In ridgetop and steep-slope positions, soils are generally loam and clay loam derived from colluvium from reddish breccias and tuffs. Stone content ranges from 35 to 50%, generally increasing on south-facing slopes, and depth to weathered parent material is usually over 1 m. Soils derived from greenish breccias and tuffs are widely distributed. The surface and subsurface horizons are loam to clay loam with up to 50% gravel content by volume. Depth to parent material is 0.6 m to 1.2 m.","2006-01-23T12:18:12.466Z"
"44","1","184","The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is underlain exclusively by bedrock of volcanic origin. Three geologic formations have been mapped for the HJA and correspond roughly with elevation (Swanson and James 1975). Little Butte Formation bedrock (< approximately 760 m elevation), dated as Oligocene to lower Miocene, consists of massive tuffs and breccias derived from mudflows and pyroclastic flows. Sardine Formation bedrock (760 m to 1200 m), dated as middle to late Micocene, consists of two units: a lower unit containing welded and non-welded ash flows (notably less altered than underlying Little Butte rocks of similar lithology), and an upper unit containing basalt and andesite lava flows. Andesitic and basaltic lava flows (>1200 m), termed ""Pliocascade"" Formation, were deposited during the Pliocene and overlie Sardine Formation material. Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 span the Little Butte-Sardine contact. Geology of these watersheds is roughly stratified by elevation. Bedrock of lower elevation areas of all three watersheds is dominated by reddish and buff-colored tuffs and breccias. At the mouth of Watershed 3, these rock types are buried under many feet of mixed colluvium exhibiting evidence of several periods of deposition. Sardine greenish tuffs and breccias dominate middle elevation bedrock in all three watersheds and extend to the ridge of Watershed 1. Associated with these rocks are numerous outcroppings of mainly basaltic flow rocks. In Watersheds 2 and 3, large portions of this bedrock are covered with a mantle (ó 20 m) of andesitic colluvium. Upper elevations in Watersheds 2 and 3 are underlain by deposits of Sardine andestic flow rock. In Watershed 1, this formation is limited to the extreme northeast corner. Most bedrock of this type is relatively unweathered with many rugged escarpments and outcroppings. Source: Swanson, F. and M. James. 1975. Geology and Geomorphology of the H. J.

Slash was burned in October, 1966. Skyline yarding equipment removed timber from the entire 237 acres of the watershed.  With this method, the back end of the logs are dragged to a fixed overhead cable, then lifted free of the ground for transport downhill to the landing.  No roads were constructed in this watershed.  Debris burning in October, 1966 consumed most of the fine logging debris on the slopes and that accumulated in the stream channel.

It was a 6 foot tower built by Rich Harnish in ~1989, but had not collected data for at least a year. Peter Doran, noting that the problem was power related (since the battery was under water and the voltage was less than 5), righted the station, and rebuilt it with new power supply, a new wind monitor, new CR10, new solar panel, and added a quantum sensor. The under water light sensors were not hooked up again nor was the barometric pressure sensor.

The lake-ice station was operated from 7 December 1993 to 6 January 1994. At that time, it was decided that maintenance of the records at the site of the old Fryxell land station was more important than the ice station so the ice station was cannibalized to re-establish the Lake Fryxell shore station, (which had been destroyed by wind the previous winter). The station was based on a 6 foot tripod which set it apart from the other Taylor Valley stations, but a 10 foot tower was subsequently installed in year 2. The land station is located a few meters above the old site to avoid rising lake levels.

During the winter of 2000 (April 18, 2000 @ 0945 to July 23, 2000 @ 2400) the datalogger failed to operate properly.

The air temperature data is convert from the original value to resistance (R) and back to temperature using the Steinhart-Hart equation.  The Steinhart-Hart Equation is an empirically developed polynomial which best represents the resistance-temperature relationships of the thermistor. The Steinhart-Hart Equation is more accurate than previously used methods; as well, it is more accurate over wider temperature ranges. The form of the equation is:

1/ Temp = a + b( LnR-Offset) + c( LnR-Offset)^3; 

where,
a = 0.00084636
b = 0.00020627

This is a float pulley potentiometer device, modified to read the potentiometer and not the current. A Stevens Type A Model 71 Water-level Recorder (chart) was the primary collection mechanism from the beginning of record through WY 1998.  The chart is still maintained as a backup.  WS#1 also relays information to the base station at Andrews Hdqtrs on an hourly basis through a Campbell Scientific radio telemetry unit.","2003-04-25T10:12:36.260Z"
"75","1","225","Historically, the site has been visited on a 3-week basis and ""check sheets"" guide the data collection and maintenance activities for the visit. Beginning WY 1993, sites are visited on a weekly basis for a quick check, with the full check every 3 weeks. The discharge measurement is initialized every visit to a reference measurement of stream height taken by a hook gage located in a stilling well.  <p>
The A-35 charts were digitized through WY 1998 with a SummaGraphics 1812 digitizer to create the final record. All CR10 and chart records are processed such that gage height is corrected to the hook gage measurements.  Time is corrected on chart data to the nearest half-hour when the Model 71 recorder clock experienced problems.  Missing periods have generally been estimated using regression equations with a paired watershed. All data is graphically displayed and corrected for general noise, logs caught in flume, etc. Range and date checks are performed on final data.  Data is stored as a series of time and stage values reduced to a series of points representing straight line segments.  Data can be aggregated at any time interval using rating equation databases.

The A-35 charts now serve as the backup to the PAT recorder. <p>The PAT was replaced on September 24, 1999 with another PAT that had been altered by the removal of the output conditioning circuit (altered PAT). The PAT output now is directly from the precision potentiometer.<p>On June 6, 1998 vandals destroyed the hook gage at WS #1. Tape measurements in the flume were used as the reference until a new hook gage was installed on July 1, 1998. The new hook gage was installed using the same elevation relationship to the flume intake as the old hook gage.","2003-04-25T10:12:36.260Z"
"75","1","227","We do not have a system of calibration for the recorders, but do have a regular and frequent system of checks that would indicate any problems. Every week a hookgage measurement is taken and compared to the recorder readings. Significant variations from the hookgage would indicate changes in recorder operation, but factors such as chart spooling, or stilling well response time during rapidly changing stage levels must also be considered. The hookgage position/elevation in relation to the flume is surveyed every year. Tri-weekly measurements of the water level in the flume also serve as a rough check of hookgage accuracy.<p>
Accuracy of the chart recorder is controlled by the gearing of the pulley standard; there is really nothing to calibrate. The same holds true for the PAT, but the potentiometer can malfunction resulting in electronic spikes or dead zones in the range of resistance, and we inspect annually to assure full range of resistance. The potentiometer has no adjustments, so it must be replaced if problems occur.

The edited data is processed by a flow computation, integration, and frequency program.  Every year each weir is inspected and surveyed.  A level is used to verify that the relative elevations of both ends of the weir blade and hook-gage bracket have not changed.The head or water depth is verified each week by a hook-gage reading.  This reading is then corrected, based on the correction factor derived from the yearly survey, and compared to A/F Logger reading.

The edited data is processed by a flow computation, integration, and frequency program.  Every year each weir is inspected and surveyed.  A level is used to verify that the relative elevations of both ends of the weir blade and hook-gage bracket have not changed.The head or water depth is verified each week by a hook-gage reading.  This reading is then corrected, based on the correction factor derived from the yearly survey, and compared to A/F Logger reading.

"104","8","185","Burns Creek along with Fox and McCree Creeks were all virgin watersheds until 1970 when a stand replacing wildfire burned through all three watersheds.  Burns Creek watershed experienced 95% intense, 3% medium and 2% light burn.  Rehabilitation treatments were as follows:  Fox – No treatment, watershed was left as roadless, pristine control.  Burns – Seeded with a grass mixture and fertilized with 250lb/acre ammonium sulfate.  McCree – Seeded with a grass mixture and fertilized with 105lb/acre urea.  Other rehabilitation work included extensive channel clearing below the gaging stations on the lower end of Burns and McCree and some sediment dams and trash racks installed.  A main haul road at the 1,066m elevation across McCree and Burns and a road at the 1,372m elevation across McCree were constructed during the summer of 1971.  A total of 4.5 miles of system road and 2.1 miles of temporary road were constructed in the Burns watershed.  Logging was initiated on these two watersheds in late fall of 1971.  Logging systems used were helicopter, tractor over a snowpack, and jammer from main haul roads over a snow pack.  Some tractor logging occurred on bare slopes under 30% and on slopes up to 40% over snow.  On March 17, 1972 unseasonably warm weather hastened snowmelt from a record high snowpack initiating a number of mass soil movements in both burned and unburned and roaded and roadless watersheds mostly below the 1,067 meter elevation.  McCree Creek experienced a debris torrent that scoured the channel to a depth of 4.57 meters and destroyed the gaging station.  During some unknown period in the spring of 1972, snow avalanches occurred on both Burns and Fox.  The avalanche on Burns was minor but the one on Fox moved considerable fallen timber and debris into the stream channel.  The extent of the damage was not discovered until May 1972.  About mid-day on June 9, 1972 a high intensity convective storm struck the upper reaches of Fox Creek depositing 33.53mm of rain in 2 hours at the 1,996 meter elevation between Fox and Burns triggering a channel scour event on Fox Creek that deposited a couple of thousand cubic meters of debris including large logs on the alluvial fan at the mouth of Fox Creek.  The Fox gaging station and the raingage located 15.24 meters above the channel near the gaging station were destroyed.  On June 10, 1972 another high intensity convective storm occurred and was centered over the headwaters of Burns, McCree and Fox Creeks at the 2,134m elevation.  In McCree the channel was previously scoured during the March 1972 event yet the event in June transported logs and debris that collected and filled behind the 1524m high road fill at the lower road crossing.  In Burns the instruments were removed from the gaging station the evening before the storm in anticipation of a possible intense storm.  The gaging station escaped serious damage and only minor sediment movement occurred in the Burns watershed.  Fox Creek, a pristine watershed experienced high runoff volumes, further channel scouring and deposition on the alluvial fan and in the Entiat River. (Klock, Glen O.; Boyer, Donald E.

Following the fire, Burns and McCree watersheds received various treatments that included grass seeding and fertilization.  Fox received no treatment and was left as a roadless, pristine control. On March 17, 1972 unseasonably warm weather hastened snowmelt from a record high snowpack initiating a number of mass soil movements in both burned and unburned and roaded and roadless watersheds mostly below the 1,067m elevation.  McCree Creek experienced a debris torrent that scoured the channel to a depth of 4.57 meters and destroyed the gaging station.  During some unknown period in the spring of 1972, snow avalanches occurred on both Burns and Fox.  The avalanche on Burns was minor but the one on Fox moved considerable fallen timber and debris into the stream channel.  The extent of the damage was not discovered until May 1972.  About mid-day on June 9, 1972 a high intensity convective storm struck the upper reaches of Fox Creek depositing 33.53mm of rain in 2 hours at the 1,996 meter elevation between Fox and Burns triggering a channel scour event on Fox Creek that deposited a couple of thousand cubic meters of debris including large logs on the alluvial fan at the mouth of Fox Creek.  The Fox gaging station and the raingage located 15.24 meters above the channel near the gaging station were destroyed.  On June 10, 1972 another high intensity convective storm occurred and was centered over the headwaters of Burns, McCree and Fox Creeks at the 2,134meter elevation.

"110","8","89",":  Until 1972, the only precipitation site was near the Burns creek weir at 914 meters elevation.  Monthly totals were read from October 1960 until October 1, 1962 when daily records began.  A recording gage was maintained at this site until 1979, but the records have many gaps caused by clock stoppage.  The records end September 30, 1972 at the Burns weir and Gage #18 at 1280 meters elevation was used for the records until December 2, 1977 but were read as monthly totals.  After 1972, storage gages were installed at several locations.  Gages at the upper elevations (about 7000 feet) were serviced only once each year, but a more frequent schedule was used for those at lower elevations.  Data from each site are recorded for the dates between observations.  Data from a recording gage at Pope Ridge is recorded here also.  Monthly precipitation from the watersheds, Pope Ridge, Lake Wenatchee, Leavenworth, and Stehekin are included to indicate regional precipitation amounts and the variation from year to year.  A total of 12 storage gages and 4 recording gages were maintained at various sites throughout the experimental forest.  Four of these gages were snow storage at high elevation and twelve were rain and snow gages.  The gages are identified by number.  A brief description follows of their locations.  These gages are also identified on the site topographic map.  
#1: At 2134 m on ridge between McCree and Brennegan watersheds on Fourmile Ridge.
#2: At 1341 m ridge between McCree and Brennegan watersheds.
#3: At 1524 m on McCree Creek near headwaters.
#4: At 1554 m on ridge between McCree and Burns watersheds.
#5: At 1036 m above McCree channel by road 5501.
#6: At 1219 m on ridge between McCree and Burns watersheds.
#7: At 914 m at Burns weir.
#8: At 1402 m at Fox weir.
#9: At 1067 m on McCree Creek just below forks.
#10: 1311 m on Burns Creek above spur road 610.
#11: At 1189 m on ridge bounding the west edge of Burns watershed.
#14: At 2134 m on Fourmile Ridge between Fox and Burns watershed.
#15: At 2134 m at headwaters of Fox watershed.
#16: At 2134 m at north edge of Fox watershed.
#17: At 1829 m in Lake Creek basin, north-northwest of Fox Creek.
#18: At 1280 m on ridge between Fox and Burns watershed.

"149","1","183","Loam and clay loam soils derived from colluvium from reddish breccias and tuffs occur in ridgetop and steep slope positions in Watersheds 1, 2, and 3. Stone content ranges from 35 to 50%, generally increasing on south-facing slopes. Depth to weathered parent material is usually over 1 m. Soils derived from greenish breccias and tuffs are widely distributed. The surface and subsurface horizons are loam to clay loam with up to 50% gravel content by volume. Depth to parent material is 0.6 m to 1.2 m. Soils derived from deep deposits of andesite colluvium occupy most of the upper portions of Watersheds 2 and 3. The surface horizon is loam to sandy loam with substantial amounts of shotty concretions and andesite stones. Subsurface horizons are massive stony loams, silt loams, or clay loams containing 25 to 80% gravel. Most soil types in Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 have moderately high field capacities (approximately 20 cm H2O for the surface 1.2 m of soil) and rapid rates of saturated moisture movement. Percolation rates are typically greater than 12 cm/hr due to the large amount and size distribution of pore spaces and stone content (Rothacher et al 1967). Stone content is the dominant factor causing variation in soil moisture storage capacity. Source: Dyrness, C. T. 1969.

"149","1","184","The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is underlain exclusively by bedrock of volcanic origin. Three geologic formations have been mapped for the HJA and correspond roughly with elevation (Swanson and James 1975). Little Butte Formation bedrock (< approximately 760 m elevation), dated as Oligocene to lower Miocene, consists of massive tuffs and breccias derived from mudflows and pyroclastic flows. Sardine Formation bedrock (760 m to 1200 m), dated as middle to late Micocene, consists of two units: a lower unit containing welded and non-welded ash flows (notably less altered than underlying Little Butte rocks of similar lithology), and an upper unit containing basalt and andesite lava flows. Andesitic and basaltic lava flows (>1200 m), termed ""Pliocascade"" Formation, were deposited during the Pliocene and overlie Sardine Formation material. Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 span the Little Butte-Sardine contact. Geology of these watersheds is roughly stratified by elevation. Bedrock of lower elevation areas of all three watersheds is dominated by reddish and buff-colored tuffs and breccias. At the mouth of Watershed 3, these rock types are buried under many feet of mixed colluvium exhibiting evidence of several periods of deposition. Sardine greenish tuffs and breccias dominate middle elevation bedrock in all three watersheds and extend to the ridge of Watershed 1. Associated with these rocks are numerous outcroppings of mainly basaltic flow rocks. In Watersheds 2 and 3, large portions of this bedrock are covered with a mantle (£ 20 m) of andesitic colluvium. Upper elevations in Watersheds 2 and 3 are underlain by deposits of Sardine andestic flow rock. In Watershed 1, this formation is limited to the extreme northeast corner. Most bedrock of this type is relatively unweathered with many rugged escarpments and outcroppings. Source: Swanson, F. and M. James. 1975. Geology and Geomorphology of the H. J.

"150","1","227","We do not have a system of calibration for the recorders, but do have a regular and frequent system of checks that would indicate any problems. Every week a hookgage measurement is taken and compared to the recorder readings. Significant variations from the hookgage would indicate changes in recorder operation, but factors such as chart spooling, or stilling well response time during rapidly changing stage levels must also be considered. The hookgage position/elevation in relation to the flume is surveyed every year. Tri-weekly measurements of the water level in the flume also serve as a rough check of hookgage accuracy. <p>
Accuracy of the chart recorder is controlled by the gearing of the pulley standard; there is really nothing to calibrate. The same holds true for the PAT, but the potentiometer can malfunction resulting in electronic spikes or dead zones in the range of resistance, and we inspect annually to assure full range of resistance. The potentiometer has no adjustments, so it must be replaced if problems occur.

"151","1","183","Loam and clay loam soils derived from colluvium from reddish breccias and tuffs occur in ridgetop and steep slope positions in Watersheds 1, 2, and 3. Stone content ranges from 35 to 50%, generally increasing on south-facing slopes. Depth to weathered parent material is usually over 1 m. Soils derived from greenish breccias and tuffs are widely distributed. The surface and subsurface horizons are loam to clay loam with up to 50% gravel content by volume. Depth to parent material is 0.6 m to 1.2 m. Soils derived from deep deposits of andesite colluvium occupy most of the upper portions of Watersheds 2 and 3. The surface horizon is loam to sandy loam with substantial amounts of shotty concretions and andesite stones. Subsurface horizons are massive stony loams, silt loams, or clay loams containing 25 to 80% gravel. Most soil types in Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 have moderately high field capacities (approximately 20 cm H2O for the surface 1.2 m of soil) and rapid rates of saturated moisture movement. Percolation rates are typically greater than 12 cm/hr due to the large amount and size distribution of pore spaces and stone content (Rothacher et al 1967). Stone content is the dominant factor causing variation in soil moisture storage capacity (Dyrness 1969).

"151","1","184","The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is underlain exclusively by bedrock of volcanic origin. Three geologic formations have been mapped for the HJA and correspond roughly with elevation (Swanson and James 1975). Little Butte Formation bedrock (< approximately 760 m elevation), dated as Oligocene to lower Miocene, consists of massive tuffs and breccias derived from mudflows and pyroclastic flows. Sardine Formation bedrock (760 m to 1200 m), dated as middle to late Micocene, consists of two units: a lower unit containing welded and non-welded ash flows (notably less altered than underlying Little Butte rocks of similar lithology), and an upper unit containing basalt and andesite lava flows. Andesitic and basaltic lava flows (>1200 m), termed ""Pliocascade"" Formation, were deposited during the Pliocene and overlie Sardine Formation material. Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 span the Little Butte-Sardine contact. Geology of these watersheds is roughly stratified by elevation. Bedrock of lower elevation areas of all three watersheds is dominated by reddish and buff-colored tuffs and breccias. At the mouth of Watershed 3, these rock types are buried under many feet of mixed colluvium exhibiting evidence of several periods of deposition. Sardine greenish tuffs and breccias dominate middle elevation bedrock in all three watersheds and extend to the ridge of Watershed 1. Associated with these rocks are numerous outcroppings of mainly basaltic flow rocks. In Watersheds 2 and 3, large portions of this bedrock are covered with a mantle (ó 20 m) of andesitic colluvium. Upper elevations in Watersheds 2 and 3 are underlain by deposits of Sardine andestic flow rock. In Watershed 1, this formation is limited to the extreme northeast corner. Most bedrock of this type is relatively unweathered with many rugged escarpments and outcroppings.

Three geologic formations have been mapped for the HJA and correspond roughly with elevation (Swanson and James 1975). Little Butte Formation bedrock (< approximately 760 m elevation), dated as Oligocene to lower Miocene, consists of massive tuffs and breccias derived from mudflows and pyroclastic flows. Sardine Formation bedrock (760 m to 1200 m), dated as middle to late Micocene, consists of two units: a lower unit containing welded and non-welded ash flows (notably less altered than underlying Little Butte rocks of similar lithology), and an upper unit containing basalt and andesite lava flows. Andesitic and basaltic lava flows (>1200 m), termed ""Pliocascade"" Formation, were deposited during the Pliocene and overlie Sardine Formation material. Watersheds 6, 7, and 8 range in elevation from 860 m to 1200 m and are underlain by two units of the Sardine Formation (Swanson and James 1975). Basalt and andesite lava flows underlie ridges of all three watersheds and near the outlets of Watersheds 7 and 8. Welded and non-welded ash flow tuffs underlie middle elevations of all three watersheds and the lower elevations of Watershed 6. This rock is of similar lithology as in the middle elevations of the lower watersheds, but is noticeably less weathered. No flow rock is exposed in Watersheds 6, 7, or 8.

1975: WS7 was broadcast burned just below the road.
1976: District planted all of WS7 in June of 1976. 
1984: The rest of the canopy in WS7 was removed.
2001: WS7 was thinned to 14 foot spacing, which leaves about 220 trees per acre. <P>
In the summer of 1974, 60% of the total basin area was removed in a shelter-
wood cut.  Temporary spur roads were constructed into the middle of and down the southwest ridge of the watershed.  Logs in the upper 60% of the watershed were yarded by tractor.  Skid trails were not preplanned, but tractor operators were instructed for safety reasons to yard downhill.  Consequently, soil compaction by tractors was limited to short segments of main skid trails immediately upslope from the upper spur road.  Logs in the lower 40% were yarded partially suspended by a skyline cable system.  Logging residue was broadcast burned only on the lower half of the watershed in the spring of 1975.

Texture is generally gravelly loam to sandy gravelly loam with gravel content ranging from 5 to 20% by volume (Dyrness and Hawk, unpublished). In most locations, effective rooting depth is virtually unlimited because of very deep, unconsolidated parent material. Silt loam soils derived from andesite and associated tuffs and breccias occupy approximately 10% of the watershed area, mostly at higher elevations in Watersheds 6 and 8 (Dyrness and Hawk, unpublished). Because the texture and structure of soils in Watersheds 6, 7, and 8 are nearly identical to those of the lower-elevation watersheds, Harr et al.

Patches of the old-growth forest, destroyed by fire and wind, have been replaced by younger age classes of Douglas-fir.

"174","14","183","Soils at Hubbard Brook are predominantly well-drained Spodosols, more specifically, Typic Haplorthods, derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures. There are no residual soils, (i.e., derived from weathered bedrock). Principal soil series are the sandy loams of the Berkshire series, along with the Skerry, Becket, and Lyman series. These soils are acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile (Table 1). A 20- to 200-mm thick forest floor layer is present, except where the soil surface has been disturbed by fallen trees. Long-term measurements suggest that the forest floor is at steady-state (Figure 4). This layer permits rapid infiltration of water and protects the soil from freezing before snow accumulates in winter (except in rare winters when snowfall is light). There is virtually no overland flow at the HBEF.
Soil depths, including unweathered till, average about 2.0 m surface to bedrock, although this is highly variable. Soil on the ridgetops may consist of a thin accumulation of organic matter, resting directly on bedrock.
The separation between the pedogenic zone and the virtually unweathered till and bedrock below is distinct. Depth to the C horizon averages about 0.6 m. At various places in the Forest, the C horizon exists as an impermeable pan. These layers restrict root development and water movement. Rocks of all sizes are scattered throughout the soil profile. In many locations boulder fields are prominent features.
A prominent feature of the surface topography throughout the HBEF is the rough pit-and-mound appearance caused by the uprooting of trees. Such uprooting mixes mineral soil from below with nutrient-rich organic surface layers and/or deposits the lower mineral layers directly on top of the forest floor humus layers without mixing, creating buried horizons. This natural disturbance changes seedbed conditions for regenerating species, and affects weathering and biogeochemical cycles.

"174","14","184","The eastern portion of the Experimental Forest (watersheds 1-6, and 9 included) is underlain by a complex assemblage of metasedimentary and igneous rocks. The major map unit is the Silurian Rangeley Formation, consisting of quartz mica schist and quartzite interbedded with sulfidic schist and calc-silicate granulite. Originally deposited as mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates, these rocks have been metamorphosed to sillimanite grade and have undergone four stages of deformation. Deformation style evident in outcrops is primarily tight isoclinal folds. However joints, slickensides and mylonites indicate brittle deformation as well. The metamorphic rocks were later intruded by a variety of igneous rocks including the Devonian Concord Granite, pegmatites, and Mesozoic diabase and lamprophyre dikes. The western portion of the forest (portions of watersheds 7 and 8 included) is underlain by the Devonian Kinsman Granodiorite, a foliated granitic rock with megacrysts of potassium feldspar.
Continental glaciers, which blanketed the region during the Pleistocene and retreated some 13,000 years ago, removed most preexisting soils. Glacial movement was primarily in a southeasterly direction as indicated by striations on bedrock surfaces, and fragments of rocks in the till which are typical of bedrock to the northwest of the Hubbard Brook Valley. Materials deposited by the glacier are highly variable in degree of sorting and grain size, ranging from clays to 10m diameter boulders. The depth of glacial deposits ranges from zero on ridgetops and in stream valleys (resulting in bedrock outcrops) to 50m in the vicinity of Mirror Lake. Poorly sorted glacial till, commonly 2m thick, covers the bedrock in most of the valley. Ice contact terraces in the lower valley, consisting of well sorted sands and gravels, are typically 10s of meters thick. Detailed studies of the sediment in Mirror Lake (some 12-13 m thick) have revealed much about the glacial history of the area.

"174","14","185","In November 1999, wollastonite (CaSiO3), pelletized with a 4% lignosulfonate binder, was applied by helicopter in a effort to replace the calcium that has been depleted from soil over the last 50 years due to inputs of acid rain. Forty-five tons of wollastonite (1.2 tonnes/ha) were added to W1 to increase the base saturation of soil from approximately 10% to 19%. The added wollastonite has a distinctive calcium to strontium ratio and strontium stable isotope ratio which will enable us to track the fate of the added material.

"175","14","183","Soils at Hubbard Brook are predominantly well-drained Spodosols, more specifically, Typic Haplorthods, derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures. There are no residual soils, (i.e., derived from weathered bedrock). Principal soil series are the sandy loams of the Berkshire series, along with the Skerry, Becket, and Lyman series. These soils are acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile (Table 1). A 20- to 200-mm thick forest floor layer is present, except where the soil surface has been disturbed by fallen trees. Long-term measurements suggest that the forest floor is at steady-state (Figure 4). This layer permits rapid infiltration of water and protects the soil from freezing before snow accumulates in winter (except in rare winters when snowfall is light). There is virtually no overland flow at the HBEF.
Soil depths, including unweathered till, average about 2.0 m surface to bedrock, although this is highly variable. Soil on the ridgetops may consist of a thin accumulation of organic matter, resting directly on bedrock.
The separation between the pedogenic zone and the virtually unweathered till and bedrock below is distinct. Depth to the C horizon averages about 0.6 m. At various places in the Forest, the C horizon exists as an impermeable pan. These layers restrict root development and water movement. Rocks of all sizes are scattered throughout the soil profile. In many locations boulder fields are prominent features.
A prominent feature of the surface topography throughout the HBEF is the rough pit-and-mound appearance caused by the uprooting of trees. Such uprooting mixes mineral soil from below with nutrient-rich organic surface layers and/or deposits the lower mineral layers directly on top of the forest floor humus layers without mixing, creating buried horizons. This natural disturbance changes seedbed conditions for regenerating species, and affects weathering and biogeochemical cycles.

"175","14","185","The first of the HBEF manipulations was undertaken to evaluate the role of forest vegetation in regulating the hydrologic and element output of a northern hardwood forest watershed (Figure 11).

In December 1965, all trees, shrubs and woody vegetation were cut with chain saw on watershed 2 (15.6 ha) and left on the ground. The forest floor was virtually undisturbed, since the trees were felled on a snow surface of about 50 cm, no products were removed and no vehicles were allowed in the area. Bromacil, a nonspecific woody herbicide, was broadcast sprayed over the watershed by helicopter in June 1966 to kill regrowth. For the next two summers, 2,4,5-T was sprayed from the ground on the persistent regrowing vegetation with backpack mist blowers. Beginning in 1969, vegetation was allowed to regrow (Likens et al. 1970; Nodvin et al. 1988; Reiners 1992).

Watershed 4 was divided into 49 east-west strips (almost following topographic contours) 25 m wide. In the autumn of 1970, every third strip was cut. The second series of strips was cut in 1972, leaving one series of strips uncut. Finally in 1974, the last set of strips was cut. Except for a variable width buffer of trees that was left along the main stream channel, the entire watershed was clear-cut in these three phases. All trees to a minimum of 5 cm were felled, and all products of value to the logging contractor were removed by rubber-tired skidder. Dense natural regrowth is occurring. Generally, regrowth of vegetation in northern hardwood stands in the area is profuse (Hornbeck et al. 1987).

"179","14","183","Soils at Hubbard Brook are predominantly well-drained Spodosols, more specifically, Typic Haplorthods, derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures. There are no residual soils, (i.e., derived from weathered bedrock). Principal soil series are the sandy loams of the Berkshire series, along with the Skerry, Becket, and Lyman series. These soils are acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile (Table 1). A 20- to 200-mm thick forest floor layer is present, except where the soil surface has been disturbed by fallen trees. Long-term measurements suggest that the forest floor is at steady-state (Figure 4). This layer permits rapid infiltration of water and protects the soil from freezing before snow accumulates in winter (except in rare winters when snowfall is light). There is virtually no overland flow at the HBEF.
Soil depths, including unweathered till, average about 2.0 m surface to bedrock, although this is highly variable. Soil on the ridgetops may consist of a thin accumulation of organic matter, resting directly on bedrock.
The separation between the pedogenic zone and the virtually unweathered till and bedrock below is distinct. Depth to the C horizon averages about 0.6 m. At various places in the Forest, the C horizon exists as an impermeable pan. These layers restrict root development and water movement. Rocks of all sizes are scattered throughout the soil profile. In many locations boulder fields are prominent features.
A prominent feature of the surface topography throughout the HBEF is the rough pit-and-mound appearance caused by the uprooting of trees. Such uprooting mixes mineral soil from below with nutrient-rich organic surface layers and/or deposits the lower mineral layers directly on top of the forest floor humus layers without mixing, creating buried horizons. This natural disturbance changes seedbed conditions for regenerating species, and affects weathering and biogeochemical cycles.

"179","14","184","The eastern portion of the Experimental Forest (watersheds 1-6, and 9 included) is underlain by a complex assemblage of metasedimentary and igneous rocks. The major map unit is the Silurian Rangeley Formation, consisting of quartz mica schist and quartzite interbedded with sulfidic schist and calc-silicate granulite. Originally deposited as mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates, these rocks have been metamorphosed to sillimanite grade and have undergone four stages of deformation. Deformation style evident in outcrops is primarily tight isoclinal folds. However joints, slickensides and mylonites indicate brittle deformation as well. The metamorphic rocks were later intruded by a variety of igneous rocks including the Devonian Concord Granite, pegmatites, and Mesozoic diabase and lamprophyre dikes. The western portion of the forest (portions of watersheds 7 and 8 included) is underlain by the Devonian Kinsman Granodiorite, a foliated granitic rock with megacrysts of potassium feldspar.
Continental glaciers, which blanketed the region during the Pleistocene and retreated some 13,000 years ago, removed most preexisting soils. Glacial movement was primarily in a southeasterly direction as indicated by striations on bedrock surfaces, and fragments of rocks in the till which are typical of bedrock to the northwest of the Hubbard Brook Valley. Materials deposited by the glacier are highly variable in degree of sorting and grain size, ranging from clays to 10m diameter boulders. The depth of glacial deposits ranges from zero on ridgetops and in stream valleys (resulting in bedrock outcrops) to 50m in the vicinity of Mirror Lake. Poorly sorted glacial till, commonly 2m thick, covers the bedrock in most of the valley. Ice contact terraces in the lower valley, consisting of well sorted sands and gravels, are typically 10s of meters thick. Detailed studies of the sediment in Mirror Lake (some 12-13 m thick) have revealed much about the glacial history of the area.

"200","36","185","The most notable research on the study site involved prescribed fire, pine silviculture, nutrient cycling and water quality.  During 1976, stream gauges were installed at the outlet of the paired watersheds under the direction of C. Ennis Young and the estimated outflow was used to evaluate the effects of prescribed fires on stream water quality and nutrient cycling.  The treatment watershed was divided into 20 pine management compartments, each 7.1 ha, with 20 m wide buffer strips left bordering the stream channels.  During the winters of 1976-77, 1977-78, and 1978-79, a total of 12 compartments were burned, four each year.  Three summer burns were also conducted during 1976-77.  Stream nutrient outputs from the treatment and control watershed were compared before and after prescribed burning.  The nutrient outputs from the treatment watershed reflected the response of an operational forest, and illustrated that periodic prescribed fires in the southeaster coastal plain pine forests are not likely to have an appreciable effect on the quality of ground or stream waters.  On September 22, 1989, the eye of Hurricane Hugo passed through the Francis Marion National Forest and the forest was badly damaged by the hurricane.  Subsequently, the treatment watershed (#77), but not the control watershed (#80), was salvage logged (Personal Communication, William Harms, Research Forester, Southern Research Station).  Water Samples were collected immediately after the hurricane and have been collected regularly since.  The watershed gauges, which had been deactivated in 1981, were reactivated in January 1990 (Bill Harms, Personal Communication).  In 1964, water level monitoring wells were placed in Watershed #77.  The measurement of these wells stopped in 1971.  In 1992, a new set of wells was placed in both watersheds.  When these wells were installed, a soil particle size analysis was run at the well sites.  These wells were manually measured until 1996.  In 1996, the manual measurements were replaced with electronic measurements by placing continuously recording well monitors on three of the wells, and creating prediction equations for the rest of the wells using the 1992-1995 data.  Manual weather measurements (rain and temperature) started at the Santee Headquarters in 1946 and today there are four weather measuring devices on the experimental forest.  Three stations measure rain and temperature:  the Lottie Road station started taking measurements in 1971, the rain gauge on Watershed #77 started taking rain measurements in 1963 and temperature measurements in 1996, and the rain gauge on Watershed # 80 started taking rain measurements in 1990 and temperature measurements in 1996.  An electronically recording weather station was erected at the Santee Headquarters in 1996, and currently measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation.  During the fall of 1994, as a part of a larger study on the recovery of the forest from Hurricane Hugo by Chuck Gresham et. al. (1994), permanent plots were located on Watershed #80.  On each plot, they conducted an inventory of trees, advanced regeneration, coarse woody debris (standing and down) and canopy density and frequency.  In addition, wells to monitor the depth of the water table were installed in each plot.  One of the preliminary conclusions from these studies was that the regeneration forest was not of the species composition of the pre-hurricane community, and that the large amount of coarse woody debris is releasing large amounts of carbon and nutrients to the ecosystems.  In 1998, a long term study of vegetation dynamics was initiated in the watersheds.  Four 0.1 ha plots were located in each of the watersheds, and the ecological importance of herbaceous and woody vegetation (density, cover or basal area, species diversity) and dimensions of trees (diameter, breast height, and height) were measured.","2003-02-11T17:00:06.503Z"

"215","36","87","The Onset Data Logging Rain Gauge consists of two major components, a tipping bucket type rainfall collector and a HOBO Event data logger.  The collector consists of a black anodized aluminum collector ring with a knife-edge and a funnel that diverts the water to a tipping-bucket mechanism.  The mechanism is designed such that one tip of the bucket occurs for each 0.01 inch or 0.25 mm of rainfall.  Bucket tips are detected when a magnet attached to the tipping bucket actuates a magnetic switch as the bucket tips, thus affecting a momentary switch closure for each tip of the bucket.  The spent water drains out of the bottom of the housing.  The switch is connected to a HOBO Event data logger which records the time of each tip.  The aluminum housing is coated with a white baked enamel surface to withstand years of exposure to the environment.","2004-06-10T13:56:35.190Z"

The collector consists of a black anodized aluminum collector ring with a knife-edge and a funnel that diverts the water to a tipping-bucket mechanism.  The mechanism is designed such that one tip of the bucket occurs for each 0.01 inch or 0.25 mm of rainfall.  Bucket tips are detected when a magnet attached to the tipping bucket actuates a magnetic switch as the bucket tips, thus affecting a momentary switch closure for each tip of the bucket.  The spent water drains out of the bottom of the housing.  The switch is connected to a HOBO Event data logger which records the time of each tip.

Samples are always taken at a fixed distance and bearing from permanent marking stakes to eliminate bias due to location. These points are aggregated by cover type (open, conifer and deciduous) and used to represent the entire area. Watershed S5_UP has courses in open and deciduous (aspen) covertypes. 
Initial snow samples are usually taken in late February and repeated every 2 weeks until the snow has melted. The summary data represent the maximum snowpack water content, though not necessarily the maximum snow depth, sampled over the course of the season. Readings are recorded on paper in the field and later transferred to electronic spreadsheets.

LTER2 was established as an experimental plot associated with the NSF funded Salt Affected Soils study in 1985. Brush was cleared, and microclimate was monitoring began. The site became one of the two LTER primary weather stations in the fall of 1987 when BNZ joined the LTER network. Instrumentation installed in June 1988 updated this station to LTER level I standard. An Omnidata logger was installed initially, but replaced by Campbell equipment during 1995 when the BNZ weather station equipment was updated. Following the upgrade, cellular phones were installed at the two weather stations so that data can be downloaded daily by modem.","2010-06-04T14:42:40.573Z"

"278","4","23","FP1A consists of an open stand of several species of willow and thinleaf alder. In 1985, when this site was established, the willows on this site were 1- 3 years of age, averaged 1 meter in height and had 20 percent. Cover and density of the most abundant shrubs were as follows: Salix nova-anglaea, 164,000 stems/ha, 15%; S. alaxensis, 59,000 stems/ha, 6%; S. brachycarpa 25,500 stems/ha, 8%. Salix interior, S. lasiandra, and Alnus tenuifolia all had cover values of less thant 5% and densities of under 20,000 stems/ha. Balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) saplings numbered 58,000/ha. The herb layer and the silt layer have varied at this site with time since last flooding and silt deposition. In general the herbaceous layer has varied from 10 to 35 percent cover and bare mineral soil from 25 to nearly 100 percent immediately after flooding. A thin leaf litter has been present during some periods but was frequently buried or swept away by flooding. The herb layer is dominated by Equisetum variegatum and Equisetum palustre. Scattered throughout the stand, but providing little cover, are the herbs, Carex aurea, Calamagrostis canadensis, Solidago canadensis, Antenarria pucherrima, and Spiranthes romanzoffiana. Arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), a halophyte, also occurs in the stand. Occasional patches of the moss Ceratodon purpurea and the liverwort, Preesia quadrata were recorded but were also short lived because of the frequent flooding and siltation. By 1995 the shrub cover had increased to 35% but average heights of the Salix spp. were still only one meter, although some individuals were over 2 m tall. The most conspicuous change in the stand has resulted from the invasion of alder seedlings between 1991 and 1993 and their rapid growth during the summer of 1995 and 1996. A few white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings (350/ha) have also established in the stand but have average heights of only 20 cm in 1994. Balsam poplar seedlings and saplings number 65,000/ha and some have reached heights of over 2 m.","2010-06-04T14:43:36.606Z"

"279","4","23","The vegetation at this site is an open, 30 year old balsam poplar stand with a dense tall shrub understory of alder. Balsam poplar density is 1200 ha with diameters ranging between 4 and 10 cm and heights of 12 15 m. Basal area of the trees was 10 m2/ha in 1985. Tree growth is rapid in this stand with an average annual diameter increase of XXX mm. The dominant vegetation in the stand is Alnus tenuifolia with a density of 6500 stems/ha , heights averaging 8 m., diameters ranging up to 15 cm and a basal area of 21 m2/ha. Occasional Salix alaxensis and S. nova anglaea also reach up itno the alder canopy. Litterfall is heavy in this stand because of the dense alder and balsam poplar canopy, with 250 g/m2/yr of leaf litter and an additional 100 gm/m2/yr of woody debris, primarily from the alder. Because of the heavy shading from the dense alder canopy, understorey vegetation is scarce with only 6 percent cover. Equisetum arvense and E. palustre are the dominant herbs but there are scattered individuals or small aptches of Calamagrostis canadensis, Equisetum variegatum, Hedysarum mackennzii, and Achillea borealis. The mosses Brachythecium salebrosum and Eurynchium puchellum are found commonly on the bases of the balsam poplar trees but have very low cover values.","2010-06-04T14:44:25.373Z"

"280","4","23","The mixed balsam poplar and white s[pruce stage is transitional between the deciduous balsam poplar stages and the conifer shite and black spruce stands. In this stand 100 year old balsam poplar are dominant in the canopy but there is a well developed understory of 40 - 50 year old white spruce that are beginning to reach into the canopy. The white spruce range from 20 - 30 cm in diameter with heights of 15-20 m while balsam poplar have diameters of from 30-50cm and are 20- 25 m in height. Density of white spruce is 480/ha and balsam poplar, 300/ha: basal area is 15m2/ha and 9 m2/ha. There is heavy mortality in the balsam poplar because of the prevalence of heart rot. The shrub layer consists primarily of Alnus tenuifolia and Rosa acicularis with a total cover of 50%. The herbaceous and moss layer in this stand is very sparse, perhaps due to frequent flooding and heavy silt deposition. the herbaceous layer covers less than 20% and is comprised of a number of species, the most common being Cornus canadensis, Equisetum arvense, and Carex concinna. Deciduous leaf and twig litter form a thick layer on the forest floor. On downed logs and under some of the larger spruce, however, patches of feathermosses, primarily Hylocomium splendens, occur. Total moss cover is under 10%.","2010-06-04T14:44:38.266Z"

Paper birch and decadent balsam poplar are scattered thoughout the stand. The shrub layer is a dominant feature of this white spruce stand. Rosa acicularis, Viburnum edule, and Alnus crispa are the most important shrubs and have a combined cover of 65%, approximately half of which is Alnus crispa. Sub shrubs and herbs also make up an importnt component of this stand, with a combined cover of nearly 70%. Linnaea borealis and Vaccinium vitis idaea are the most common sub shrubs on the forest floor while the herbaceous layer is made up primarily of Equisetum arvense, Geocaulon lividum, Pyrola segunda and P. asarifolia, Cornus canadensis, and the orchids Goodyera repens and Calypso bulbosa. The forest floor is comprised of a thick nearly continuous mat of feathermosses, primarily Hylocomium splendens, Rhytidiadelphus trequetrus and Ptilium crista castrensis. There are a few scattered clumps of Peltigera canina and Cladonia species in the moss mat, but their combined cover is less than 1%.","2010-06-04T14:44:55.000Z"

"283","4","23","The 1983 Rosie Creek fire occurred in late May and early June. By September of that year, herbaceous cover was 31% and dominated by Geranium bicknellii and Epilobium angustifolium. Shrub sprouts covered an additional 2.5%. The following year the herbaceous cover totaled 80% and was dominated by Equisetum arvense, Geranium bicknellii, Epilobium angustifloium, Dracocephalum parviflorum, and Corydalis sempivirens. Shrub cover was 2% and tree cover less than 1%. In 1988, 5 years after the fire the herbaceous cover had reached 94% and was dominated by Equisetum arvense, Epilobium angustifolium, and Calamagrostis canadensis. Shrub cover, primarily Rubus idaeus, Rosa acicularis and Viburnum edule, was 12%. A few scattered individuals of Betula papyrifera, and Populus tremuloides had a total cover in the stand of only 1%. By 1995, 12 years after the fire, total herb cover had been reduced to 50% and was still dominated by Equisetum arvense, Epilobium angustifoium and Calamagrostis canadensis but Pyrola secunda had developed 4% cover. Some of the herbaceous cover was replaced by mosses, primarily Polytrichum juniperinum. Low shrubs, primarily Linnaea borealis, had 20% cover and the same species of tall shrubs, had only 8% cover. Tree cover had increased to 12%. Picea glauca seedlings in 1995 had reached heights of 60 cm and had a density of 1000/ha. Total tree numbers of Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera were only 300/ha but a large number of saplings (nearly 10,000/ha) of the deciduous species will reach tree size (2.5 cm DBH) in the next few years. The original stand had 450 white spruce trees/ha with a basal area of 35m2/ha. These trees were all killed by the fire but most remained standing. By 1997 the standing dead trees had been reduced to 67/ha with a basal area of 3.4 m2/ha.","2010-06-04T14:45:29.626Z"

"284","4","23","This dense mixed stand of white spruce, paper birch, balsam poplar, and aspen originated following a wildfire between 1910 and 1915. The deciduous species dominate the tree canopy but white spruce is beginning to replace the deciduous species as succession proceeds. Present (1993) density per hectare of trees is 1675 for paper birch, 1492 for white spruce, 192 for balsam poplar and 17 for aspen: corresponding basal area for the four species is 18.5, 7.1, 4.4, and 0.6 m2/ha for a stand total of 30.6 m2/ha. Dominant tree heights of all four species are between 15 and 22 meters(average 18m). Because of the dense tree canopy cover (85%) and the heavy leaf litter, shrub and herb cover is relatively low. Herbs and low shrubs, primarily Linnaea borealis, Equisetum arvense and Calamagrostis canadensis, have a total cover of 23%. There is also a 20% cover of Rosa acicularis and Viburnum edule. Moss cover is less than 10% because of the heavy leaf litter deposition.","2010-06-04T14:45:47.300Z"

"285","4","23","This mature white spruce stand originated in approximately 1780 as a result of wildfire. Picea glauca is the dominant tree but occasional Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides persist beneath the spruce canopy. Diameters of the dominant spruce range from 35 to 45 cm, and heights average 25 m with some individuals of 36 m. Spruce tree density in 1993 was 493/ha with a basal area of 32 m2/ha. Scattered shrubs of Alnus crispa and Viburnum edule make up less than 1% cover. Herbaceous cover is also low and consists primarily of Calamagrostis canadensis, Geocaulon lividum, and Pyrola secunda. The forest floor is covered by a moss mat of Hylocomium splendens.","2010-06-04T14:46:02.910Z"

"286","4","23","FP5C is an open stand of black spruce with widely scattered individuals of tamarack (Larix laricina) Total tree canopy is 32%. Tree density in 1989 totaled 2684 trees per hectare of which 2667 were black spruce and 17 were tamarack. Total basal area of the stand is 14.7 m2/ha nearly all of which is black spruce. Average diameter of the dominant black spruce is 15 cm, and heights range from 10 to 15 m but average diameter for all of the black spruce in the stand is only 8 cm. The dominant spruce and tamarack are about 150 years old, but occasional younger trees occur. The tall shrub layer has 21% canopy cover and is primarily of Alnus crispa and Rosa acicularis, with widely scattered Salix glauca, Salix arbusculoides, and Salix planifolia. The low shrub layer is conspicuous with 76% cover; mainly Ledum groenlandicum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. Common herbs are Equisetum scirpoides, E. arvense, Poa sp. and Calamagrostis canadensis. with a total herbaceous cover of 25%. The nearly continuous moss cover (83%) is dominated by Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi. Lichens have 7% cover , primarily Peltigera aphthosa.","2010-06-04T14:46:17.626Z"

"294","32","199","Sampling Design: Stations were sited across the entire Sevilleta and surrounding areas to cover the entire spatial and elevational extent of the refuge.  They were also generally located adjacent to other pertinent study locations such as plant and animal monitoring studies. Measurement Techniques: Automated weather stations. Weather station includes a 3 m tripod tower on which is mounted most of the monitoring equipment.  This equipment includes an enclosure which houses a datalogger and power supply. On the tripod are mounted a solar radiation shield which encloses a combination temperature and relative humidity sensor, anemometer and wind vane, and a pyranometer. Other attached sensors are a precipitation gauge, soil temperature sensors and soil moisture potential sensors.","2010-08-16T17:29:28.280Z"

"382","21","16","Flow is monitored with a 120-degree V-Notch Weir Blade attached to concrete cutoff walls, which are perpendicular to the channels and long enough to force all flow through the weirs. S-6 Weir is equipped with a Belfort model FW-1 strip chart recorder. The recorder is mounted above the float wells in a pond behind the weir and housed in a plywood shelter. A float and pulley system is used to monitor water depth in the weir notch. Chart readings are adjusted to match weekly aluminum point gauge readings. Point gauge and weir notch elevations are verified annually against a known benchmark. The recorder is cleaned and lubricated at least annually. A plywood cover over the weir helps prevent freezing during transitional periods.","2004-06-23T11:49:40.486Z"

"382","21","18","Data have been collected continuously from S6 weir since 1964.  Positive flows usually begin in late March with snowmelt and continue through early winter.
 
Recorder chart readings are adjusted to match weekly aluminum point gauge readings. Point gauge and weir notch elevations are verified annually against a known benchmark. All recorders are cleaned and lubricated at least annually.

Depth values in the weirs are calculated from the recorder charts using Sigma Scan and a SummaSketch III Professional digitizing pad to create data files, which are processed with a MS Visual Basic script to calculate mean daily flow rates.

A 16-ft by 16-ft split-rail fence with two rails surrounds the station. The terrain is rolling Piedmont Plateau and the station is a few hundred yards from the top of a gradually rising hill; however, the slope is only 2 or 3 percent in the vicinity of the station. This location was selected because it is approximately as representative of meso-scale conditions as would be a typical 1st-order weather station at an airport. The McDonogh1 is the primary or reference meteorological station for BES, and it provides the best meteorological representation for the Gwynns Falls watershed, which is the focus of much of BES research. The Gwynns Falls watershed approximates an oval with its downstream end near the center of Baltimore and the limit of headwaters 30 km to the northwest; the McDonogh1 station is about 20 km from the downstream end.","2009-08-25T13:24:39.530Z"

"404","3","31","The station has been at this location since the initial setup on April 26, 2000.  The first complete day of record is April 27, 2000. Surrounding ground cover and buildings have not changed. Measurements include wind speed and direction at 2-m height, air temperature and humidity at 1.5-m height, global solar radiation, global photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), reflected PAR, net all-wave radiation, soil temperature at 2 and 10 cm, volumetric soil moisture averaged from the surface to 20 cm, and soil heat flux at 2 cm. Air temperature is measured most accurately with a fan-aspired radiation shield, but a measurement of temperature with an RTD included in the humidity sensor in a Gill style radiation shield provides a backup temperature measurement that is somewhat more influenced by radiation. The global solar radiation and PAR sensors have functioned continuously, but others have had some periods of non-function that are indicated by the flags in the ClimDB data sets. Until 1100 on March 17, 2004, most variables were averaged on hourly intervals. Since that time, most variables are averaged on 15-min intervals.","2009-08-25T13:24:39.563Z"

"404","3","39","Air temperature is measured by a 100-ohm platinum resistance temperature devise (RTD) in a fan-aspirated radiation shield custom produced by REBS (Radiation and Energy Balance Systems, Seattle, WA).  The RTD is inside a 1-inch diameter inner tube that is centered in an outer 2-inch diameter anodized aluminum tube.  The air intake faces north. Temperature is also measured at the same height by a Campbell Scientific HMP45C temperature and humidity sensor that is located in a 12-plate R.M. Young Gill type naturally ventilated radiation shield.","2009-08-25T17:35:09.013Z"
"404","3","40","The data logger is a Campbell Scientific CR23X. Until 17 Mar 04, data were recorded hourly at 30 minutes after the hour with the hour labeled as the previous even hour; thus the data labeled as 0200 are measured from 0130 to 0230. Mean daily values during this time are the averages of hourly means over the 24 hours from 0100 to midnight, which is effectively from 0030 of the labeled day to 0030 of the following day. The hourly means are the averages of measurements at 5-s intervals. For each hour, absolute maximum and absolute minimum values from the 720 measurements were recorded. Absolute daily maximums are the highest hourly maximums and absolute daily minimums are the lowest hourly minimums of the day. This system optimizes comparison of hourly means with data from NOAA ASOS stations, for which hourly values are means over brief time periods near the top of each hour. A disadvantage is that comparison of daily maximum and minimum values may differ, because our reported daily maximum or minimum values may occur not during the labeled day, but between 0000 and 0030 of the following day or a maximum or minimum may actually occur between 0000 and 0030 of a labeled day and not be recorded.","2009-08-25T17:35:09.013Z"
"404","3","41","Sensors have remained unchanged since the initiation of the weather station. The fan on the REBS shield has been out of commission at several times; during these periods the HMP45C sensor has been used to provide an estimate of air temperature (data flagged E).","2009-08-25T17:35:09.030Z"
"404","3","42","The initial manufacturers calibrations have been used for the duration of the operation of the station. McDonogh climDB uses temperature data from REBS for its better accuracy. But as the fan stopped working properly on March 25, 2009, the REBS data lost the accuracy until it was repaired on July 8, 2009. HMP data are referenced to correct REBS data for the period in question. In order to test the substitutability of HMP for this period, the 15 minute raw data from March to May of 2008 were compared between REBS and HMP on the assumption that monthly temperature pattern should be consistent in 2008 and 2009. In case of daily mean temperature, the differences (REBS – HMP) were all within manufacturer’s specifications accuracy (+/-0.2 C). Thus, for daily mean air temperature, HMP data were used instead of REBS for the time period. For the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, the differences were all beyond the accuracy range, and so temperatures were estimated in the following way. For example, in March 2008, the monthly average of difference between daily minimum REBS and HMP temperatures is -0.246129. Simply put, REBS – HMP = -0.246129. By this logic, the daily minimum and maximum temperatures were calculated by adding the monthly average difference to the actual daily HMP data. The following is an example of daily minimum air temperature, t, on March 25, 2009. t = HMP minimum temperature + monthly average difference between REBS and HMP. t = -4.143 + (-0.246129) = -4.39","2009-08-25T17:35:09.013Z"

"413","46","4","The Maybeso Experimental Forest was established in 1956 to study hill slope erosion, changes in fish habitat, forest regeneration and silviculture responses to pre-commercial thinning following intensive timber harvest.  It is part of the temperate rainforest and is characterized by a cool moist climate.  The mean temperature is 6.7degC with an average rainfall of 276 cm annually.  The dominant conifers are Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla).  Others include Alaska cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) .  Red alder (Alnus rubra) is the most common deciduous tree in the watershed.  The watershed is also home to pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).  Long term data collected (intermittent) includes: hydrology (flow and rainfall), silviculture (thinning plots), stream channel morphology and salmonid habitat.  Research results include establishing thinning regimes for Sitka spruce, management of harvest on steep slopes to avoid landslides, management of large wood in streams and alder and watershed productivity.","2004-05-19T15:40:36.166Z"

"414","47","4","The intention of the Kings River Experimental Watershed (KREW) is to be as holistic and integrated as possible with a focus on headwater stream ecosystems and their associated watersheds. It is designed as a long-term study with a 15-year minimum period of study starting in 2000. KREW is part of the larger Kings River Project which is working to develop forest management techniques for sustainable forest ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada. The approach includes the following activities.
?  Prescribed fire and uneven-aged, small-group tree harvesting
?  Maintain older trees, large snags, and large woody debris throughout the landscape
?  Maintain a mosaic of vegetation types and ages that mimic, to the extent possible, the historical distribution of vegetation resulting from frequent, low-intensity fires prevalent before European settlement of the western United States

KREW has the following goals.
?  Quantify the existing condition and variability in the characteristics of headwater stream ecosystems and their associated watersheds
?  Evaluate the effects of forest management on the characteristics of stream ecosystems and their associated watersheds
?  Shares the approach for the Kings River Project of which it is a part

The development plan for KREW is outlined below.
?  4 years to instrument and design (2000-2003)
?  4 to 5 years of pretreatment data: 	
-Providence Site started 1 October 2002
-Bull Site started 1 October 2003
?  2 years to treat both areas:
-Providence Site starts summer of 2007
-Bull Site starts summer of 2008
?  5 to 7 years of post-treatment data collection	

KREW is being designed to evaluate pattern and process on the landscape. The selected measurements will allow evaluation of:
?  Nutrient budgets (water, soil, and vegetation)
?  Sediment budget
?  Soil condition
?  Stream food web and/or energy budget 
?  Geologic and geomorphic processes
?  Vegetation and fuel loading characteristics
?  Riparian microclimate
?  Air pollution loadings

KREW will be addressing several questions posed in the Sierra Nevada Framework (US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service 2001).
1.  What is the effect of fire and fuel reduction treatments (i.e., thinning of trees) on the riparian and stream physical, chemical, and biological conditions?
2.  Does the use of prescribed fire increase or decrease the rate of erosion (long term versus short term) and affect soil health and productivity?
3.  How adequate and effective are current stream buffers at protecting aquatic ecosystems?","2012-02-16T17:00:32.736Z"

Effects on salmon spawning were studied from 1949-1966; changes in stream flow, water temperature, and water quality effects of timber harvest were included in this study.  Apparent acceleration of soil mass movement, after logging, was identified in 1962.  Studies on the relationship between landslide occurrence, geology and geomorphology, soil creep, soil hydrology, tree root strength and deterioration occurred.  Natural regeneration following clearcutting was investigated on a 700 acre cutting unit starting in 1955.  This study continued during the initial regeneration-establishment period until 1962.  Studies include seed dispersal distance, pattern, and timing; drainage and seed factors; advanced regeneration; and the effects of small mammals on regeneration.  In 1974, a study of the effects of stand density on tree growth began and continues to the present.  Plots were installed in second-growth stands that originated after logging in 1954, and trees were thinned to three levels of stocking.","2003-10-23T12:33:46.226Z"

The dominant conifers are mature Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Two streams, called East and West Creeks by research personnel, originate in cirques, roughly parallel each other, and empty into Young Bay about 365 m apart.  Both streams support pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), and Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma). Stream gaging stations were installed in both streams in 1958 (intermittent until 1963).  In 1966 an artificial stream channel was planned for juvenile fish habitat research.

"519","1","31","At the confluence of 2 roads in moderate forest. Site is thus unusual by having large open areas radiating out from it through the surrounding forest. Attenuation is completely by surrounding trees, about 20 m from sensor in each direction. More open to direct radiation from the southwest for most months (direct sun in the mornings). During June and July site receives direct radiation through much of the day but during other months sun is blocked by forest wall to the south. (JWS 2001)","2009-08-18T18:00:34.286Z"

Very open, in a large clear-cut. Presence of young trees growing in clearcut provides some insolation blockeage; nearest forest starts due east 70-80 m. Due to openness and reliability of insolation and temperature data, this site was used to determine percentages of diffuse and direct radiation for each month in the study.

"540","37","181","The Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest encompasses 3693 hectares (9,125 acres) at the headwaters of Tenderfoot Creek in the Little Belt Mountains on the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Meagher Country, Montana. It is approximately 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of White Sulphur Springs, Montana, or 114 kilometers (71 miles) southeast of Great Falls, Montana.This upper portion of the tenderfoot Creek watershed is heavily forested. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and mixed lodgepole pine with Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands are the dominant forest types and occupy about 95% (3,514 ha) of the experimental forest. Wet, irregularly shaped meadows are interspersed throughout the forest but only cover approximately 3.5% (125 ha), of the area. High, exposed hillsides with scree slopes and some dry grass communities make up the remaining 1.5% (54 ha) of the research area.","2005-04-11T09:04:25.333Z"
"540","37","182","Lodgepole pine stands on the experimental forest form a mosaic, typical of fire-prone upland forests at moderate to high altitudes in the Northern Rocky Mountains. The forest stands are classified as 1-aged (47% of the forested area) and 2-aged (53% of the forested area) which were created by past stand replacement and mixed severity fires. Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) grows in the area""s sparse but species-rich wetlands, while whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) grace the higher ridge tops.

Average stocking density is 2150 stems/ha (870 stems/ac)
Average basal area is 46 m2/ha (200 ft2/ac)
LAI of dominant species: lodgepole pine = 2.8, spruce-fir = 3.0

"540","37","183","The most extensive soil groups are the loamy skeletal, mixed Typic Cryochrepts and clayey, mixed Aquic Cryoboralfs.  Rock talus slopes are prominent on the perimeter of the landscape, but rock outcrops are confined chiefly to areas adjacent to main stream channels.  Soils in the grassland parks range from well to poorly drained.  Seeps and springs are common over the entire Experimental Forest.   No depth or porosity information is available at this time.","2005-04-11T09:04:25.333Z"
"540","37","184","The geology of the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest is simple in terms of the rock and sediment units present and the geologic structure of the area. By contrast, the geologic history records a complex series of events that has influenced both the succession of rock units and the erosion that has produced the present physiography of the area.  The rock units are exposed in the area and the surficial sediments that mantle the forest provide evidence of the history of events that led to the present configuration. 

The geology is characterized by igneous intrusive sills of quartz porphyry, Wolsey shales, Flathead quartzite, and granite gneiss.  The northern part of the forest occupies the highest elevations and steepest upland topography and is underlain by igneous intrusive granitic rocks.  The arched bedrock in the area was formed from metasediments of Cambrian Age consisting mainly of argillites and quartzites.  Glaciation has influenced the landform producing broad basins in which the streams are beginning to regain a water-carved dendritic pattern.

"540","37","186","Four forest habitat types are present on the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest:

subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry; subalpine fir/blue huckleberry; subalpine fir/bluejoint; subalpine fir-whitebark pine/grouse whortleberry. 
Besides these four climax types, a portion of the Forest keys to the lodgepole pine/huckleberry community type.  In this case, however, the community type is attributable to the subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry habitat type because of the extensive and continuous presence of fir regeneration and old growth throughout the Forest.  Within each habitat type there are stands of different age classes occurring intermittently throughout the Forest.  There are also four other general land descriptions classified for the forest: talus slopes, rock outcrops, grassland parks and wet meadows.

"540","37","187","Recently installed treatment units are located in two sub-watersheds 1) Sun Creek which flows north into Tenderfoot Creek and 2) Spring Park Creek which flows south into Tenderfoot Creek.  Sub-watersheds immediately west and adjacent to the treatment sub-watersheds (Bubbling Creek adjacent to Sun Creek and Upper Stringer adjacent to Spring Park Creek) are hydrologically matched with adjoining treatment sub-watersheds and are used as control sub-watersheds.  The Onion Park RNA, which comprises the headwaters of Tenderfoot Creek and is adjacent and immediately upstream (east) from both treatment sub-watersheds, is also used as a control area.","2005-04-11T09:04:25.350Z"

"783","20","23"," Much plant, animal, and ecosystem research has taken place in tabonuco forest near El Verde Field Station, operated by the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies of the University of Puerto Rico. El Verde is at 350 m elevation, with mean rainfall 3450 mm per year. The soils are of volcanic origin. Work on the plant community at El Verde has focused on the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot. There are 89 tree species in the LFDP. The commonest are Prestoea acuminata, Casearia arborea, Dacryodes excelsa, Manilkara bidentata, Inga laurina, and Sloanea berteriana. The commonest shrubs are Palicourea riparia, Psychotria berteriana, and Piper glabrescens. Grasses, ferns, and forbs are frequent on the ground, especially in canopy gaps; epiphytes are fairly common, and vines are uncommon. The Bisley Experimental Watersheds are another main LUQ study area in tabonuco forest. At El Verde, Bisley, and elsewhere in the mountains LUQ also conducts intensive sutdies on stream ecology.","2014-09-03T16:38:23.946Z"
