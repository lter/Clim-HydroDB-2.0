attributeName	attributeDefinition	class	unit	dateTimeFormatString	missingValueCode	missingValueCodeExplanation
VariableCode	"User or organization-defined code to describe the variable. If for example, you are measuring streamflow, you may name this SF"	character				
VariableName  "Full text name of the variable that was measured, observed, modeled, etc. Example: Streamflow. Choose from the Variable Name controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV&id=1157579162"	character				
VariableUnitsName	"The name of units of the data values associated with a variable. Example: degree. Choose from the Units controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=Units&id=1125579048"	character				
DataType	"The recorded value over the time interval being sampled. Example: average. Choose from the DataType controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=DataTypeCV&id=789577851"	character				
SampleMedium	"The medium in which the sample or observation was taken or made. Example: Surface water. Choose from the SampleMedium controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=SampleMediumCV&id=821577965." 	character				
ValueType	"Text value indicating what type of data value is being recorded. Example: Field Observation. Choose from the ValueType controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=ValueTypeCV&id=1141579105"	character				
IsRegular	"Value indicates whether the data values are from a regularly sampled time series. Choose TRUE or FALSE."	character						
TimeSupport	"Numerical value that indicates the time support (or temporal footprint) of the data values. 0 is used to indicate data values that are instantaneous. Other values indicate the time over which the data values are implicitly or explicitly averaged or aggregated. The Timesupport goes along with TimeUnitsName if IsRegularlyMeasured = TRUE." 	character				
TimeUnitsName	"The name of units of the time support. If TimeSupport is 0, indicating an instantaneous observation, a unit needs to still be given for completeness, although it is somewhat arbitrary. Choose from the Units controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=Units&id=1125579048"	character				
GeneralCategory	"General category of data. Example: Hydrology. Choose from the GeneralCategory controlled vocabulary: http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=GeneralCategoryCV&id=805577908"	character				
NoDataValue	"Numeric value used to encode no data values for this variable. When formatting the Data Values table, use this number to indicate no data value was measured."	character
